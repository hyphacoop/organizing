[Hypha](https://hypha.coop) is a worker co-operative based out of Ontario, Canada.
We use this website to index our coordination notes from [hyphacoop/organizing](https://github.com/hyphacoop/organizing).

During our virtual meetings, we use [HackMD](https://hackmd.io) to take notes collaboratively with in-progress :seedling: pads that are [accessible to members only](https://hackmd.io/VN4ltoJJTwWSVdODqfBf2w).
These meeting notes are then reviewed and archive on [GitHub](https://github.com/hyphacoop/organizing) with open or restricted :lock: access according to the _Working Open_ guidelines in our [Handbook](https://handbook.hypha.coop/working-open.html).

<span class="small">This website is created with [jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) with the [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme.</span>
