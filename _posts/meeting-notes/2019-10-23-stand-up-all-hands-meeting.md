- Person: yurko (patcon accidentally took in another spot)
	- last: bank account. online access. #todo create access. interac later.
	- next: move :moneybag: to desjardins. #feedback on money moving. money decisions.
	- blockers: waiting on interac before deposit.
	- last: 
	    - Bank finally setup
	    - Not sure signers/admins created theirs yet
	    - Started reaserch on other financial services
	- next: 
	    - work towards moving money from RBC to Dejardins
	- blockers: 
	    - Waiting on interac E-Transfer
	    - Look into alternative (MTF or what not)
- Person: bl
	- last:
	    - Made proposal for comm tools guidelines, I think it's important to agree on shared practice urgently
	    - Looked into PIAA language in GitHub/GitLab, I like it, and can take on drafting a version for Canada and co-op structure if I get go-ahead
	    - Looked into QB pricing based on recommendations of our accountant, costs about CAD 55-70 each month. It's a lot for us at this point. I want to get advice on how to move forward, but to resolve this ASAP
	    - Working with uv on distributed.press proposal
	    - Would like someone else to lead mesh game proposal, although I'd like to actively participate, and has lots of potential partners I can connect
    - next:
	    - Communication Guidelines draft
	    - PIAA draft
	    - Have Bookkeeping software purchased and start billing clients with it
	- blockers:
        - Need feedback on [Communication Guidelines](https://github.com/hyphacoop/organizing/issues/132)
        - Need feedback from Governance WG and uv on how to proceed with [PIAA](https://github.com/hyphacoop/organizing/issues/95)
        - Need pc and yj to review [PR: Financial Accounts and Practices](https://github.com/hyphacoop/handbook/pull/22)
        - Need a go-ahead to get QB and start billing for Aether, I don't know who I need permission from before subscribing to QB (recommend to get one shared access account + payroll to start which will be CAD 55 / month for us), see [issue](https://github.com/hyphacoop/organizing/issues/122)
            - Can I go ahead and purchase this with personal credit card and reimburse later? (first 3 months is $6 it's very low risk, and we can wait a little to add payroll)
            - If this required input from our bookkeeper, can pc get in touch?
- Person: DC
	- last: 
	    - Opportity lead things

	    - Issues that are not being addressed that seem important in business plan/finance
	    - Feeling discouraged: Business plan items not moved over, flagged issues a few times

    - last:
        - Call with bl on distributed press last week
        - Working on hypha introduction deck, which could potentially be useful for pitching to leads

## Discussions
- QB Pricing and payment
    - pc: can we auth ben to make payment? should we?
    - yj: decision feels final on tool. prefer not to reopen that convo. but do we need it yet? how will it work?
        - dc: some wrinkles, but we should just pick a date for first payroll. #todo
        - let's just give a deadline. and do some things together.
        - no invoices sent yet? if so, feels non-urgent.
        - yj: we are blocked on invoicing.
        - dc+pc: clip decided already. yj: was just an estimate. #todo improved projections.
        - dc: do we need to start payroll right away? sounds like in one month (beg. Dec) especially if invoices on cusp of being sent out.
            - but no payroll pay period has been decided.
            - #recommendation: credit card right away. #todo research yj
                - open Q: who should get card? dc: directors? minimal paperwork for low limit.
    - dc: interpretation fin-wg doesn't need permission of whole, and can make call itself.
        - :+1: yurko, pc
    - dc: maybe future threshold where we don't need to ask, but TBD
    - bookkeeper stuff
        - pc: i didn't think we were using a bookkeeper yet until we got feedback (we're not paying anyone)
        - we know enough to start, so let's just start. :+1: dc, yj

- Business Plan items moved over to other places
    - dc: feels like we've reresearched a couple things. poor job of transmitting info for some reason. feel silly about that. feel like i have a good memory for business plan.
        - dc: pieces i put time into are the ones we keep revisiting.
        - yj: loomio and github diff. pointed out by bl. info lost. prob rustiest on business plan. feel for dawn.
        - dc: formats dont work for everyone. ties to comms convo. but also already had part of that convo. seems expectations have shifted (chat seems to have become priority channel for some)
        - e.g. spreadsheets and bizplan.
        - pc: crossref into issues. or presentation to all.
            - dc: presentation kinda done.
            - crossref/split. was the ideal, to close off then split out. but didn't happen. half-closed state currently.
        - pc: suggestion pairing.
- design workshop from nomadic labs
    - garry is onboard
    - makes sense for capacibty issues
    - one flag is that these workshops are best in person. ben is almost perma-away. patcon gone for awhile, maybe back 1-2wks in dec, but otherwise might be until end of jan.
        - luisa in TO oct30 - nov8
        - #todo organize social thing or drinks while luisa in Toronto. (earlier the better)
        - gi: weekends > evening weekdays >> daytime weekday

- DECISION: DAWN CULTIVATES Oct 29 - Nov 27
