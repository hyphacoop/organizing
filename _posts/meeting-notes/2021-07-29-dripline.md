## Notes

### Discussions

#### Two posts

1. Making change
2. Mai's piece

#### Deployment

- Staging uses a self-signed certificate. This is important because we aren't rate limited by the CA.
    - https://letsencrypt.org/docs/staging-environment/

#TODO dc created issue. el to close by adding to readme

- PR doesn't trigger deploy
    - dc: infra suggested switching to gh actions
    - deprecate travis CI

- switch from TravisCI to Github Actions
- Have staging
- Have deploy trigged on staging by PR or direct commit
- Have deploy on master triggered by commit

If GH actions supports environments from at PR then we handle reviews directly in PRs to master
If GH actions does not support environments in PR (aka reviewing not having to be local to device) then we use a staging flow

Proposed flow (not using this):
- Make master protected
- Branch feature branch off of master
- Develop on feature branch
- PR to staging
- If feature complete (not QA'd), merge to staging
- Fix bugs and test on staging
- PR from staging to master

^ This flow is too heavy

Flow (we'll use this):
- Branch feature branch off of master
- Develop on feature/post branch
- If feature/post complete (not QA'd), merge to staging. No need to ping for review
- Fix bugs and test on staging
- PR from staging to master (ping for review here)

How do we deal with publishing to Dweb?

#TODO el to check and see what it will take to deploy to dweb through GH actions.
- think encypted secrets work: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets

What do we do about this? https://github.com/hyphacoop/hypha.coop/pull/35

- dc: who's doing this? (maintaining packages on website)
- el is able monitor pr's to repo and to merge dependabot PR's
- https://github.com/pulls/review-requested
    -#TODO Dc to add codeowner file with el 

What to do if htmlproofer is missing?
- we replace link with an archive.lrg link
- or use htmlproofer ignore 
    - e.g. we use this for the ipns link ingnore `<a href="https://ipfs.distributed.press/ipns/hypha.coop{{ page.url }}" data-proofer-ignore>ipns://hypha.coop</a>`
    - https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer#ignoring-content

#TODO add instructions to readme

What to do about auto resizing images for web optimization?
- dc: there are many options, should find one that works with gh + jekyll

#TODO dc add issue for web optimization

#TODO fixes hypha.coop/dripline/
- page should be responsive
- lead in text is too small
- content of lead in text should have something more about hypha's writing practice
dc add issues, and check in here if we've already thought about this before https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Otvfq0VIJfqevsq5SisB7-uovEDL18CXLwXrzqggl7k/edit#heading=h.6i3rtlvx1p0f
