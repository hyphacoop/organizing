## Notes

* Cooperos
    * young cooperative; most members in early 20s
    * Jacobo - was in academia before
    * simpler development projects; web apps and websites; CRMs
* Hypha
    * BL: gives overview of Hypha work
    * Starling 
    * Cosmos: we do the testnet
- J: very challenging to start a cooperative in Mexico; just were incorporated as a co-op last month
- first in Monterrey; but good to be established and see if they can grow the co-op space
- have talked with Argentine co-ops and learned a lot from them
- BL: talks about the challenges of starting; all started as part time and now we have a lot of work and people is the challenge (labour)
- BL: goal of these calls: figure out how we can work together, what are the opportunities
- J: most of the members are part-time; but also have lots of work right now
- BL: roots in open source, editable and open culture. But need to have convo about what to keep private
- idea in some ways is to productive the org... so other orgs can reuse Hypha learning 
- Handbook is an ongoing project... needs to be updated
- internal org development is a lot of work!
- J: how to establish wages/salaries?
- BL: points to handbook resource; outlines clip model used initially & talks about how complex this was
- move to salary model to maintain consistency for members
- J: in Spanish, talk about returns (?) not salary because they're worker-members. This distinction is important
- guidelines for pay: need (does anyone have needs); hours worked (but this is complicated); experience/seniority (but this isn't a distinction yet; want to keep things flat)
- BL: think about risk and initial work of members; responsibilities is the other key thing. How much resp versus hours worked
- J: they also have a multiplier for responsibility

- (before) https://handbook.hypha.coop/finance.html#calculating-member-wages 
- BL: need to strike balance to ensure that you can hire a range of people; pay too low and you only can hire Jr staff. Can also have the opposite issue
- J: Cecosesola, a Venezuelan org. Have managed to keep their org very flat
- Tierra Comun - other Mexican tech cooperative
- J: about their projects - near shore model. close to Us so not offshore, but not US either so cheaper
