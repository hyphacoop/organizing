        - Outline
            - Length: 500-900 wds
            - Key Takeaway(s):

Introduction:
- thesis statement:
  - distributed systems are more resilient but confusing to debug

- Key points:
  - surprising that is restored by itself from other messages
  - recreating acounts auto-restored for people

1. What happened?
5Ws: What, what, where, when, why? (can re-use a lot from the incident report) 
[If you want a description about how to write this: "Write a blog post using the 5Ws" https://kathrynaragon.com/blog/write-blog-post-simple-5-ws/]

2. What was surprising was that even though ... accounts were lost .... recovered by... This was because ...

3. Why is this different from if we were using slack?
    - could this type of problem even happen if we were using slack?

Conclusion

- Month to write it, then a month to review and publish
- TODO Elon will give us a draft 4 weeks from today, i.e., Oct 28
- TODO Dawn to share outline of pt. 2 of cooperating series: radical coops / solidarity economy thing? -> Async by Oct 14
