## Notes

### Personal Checkins

- Udit has had a busy week
- andi is glad the weather is warmer today

### Announcements

- No announcements 


### Discussions

- uv: on the original purpose/vision of Dripline - noticed that people tend to ask same questions and for same resources through Hello Hypha emails; wanted a place to point them to
- so from a pratical POV: (1) a go-to place that collected this information
- But also (2) a relationship builder. Use as a way to connect with people outside Hypha e.g. people we look up to
- Creates a place to co-create writing, gather thoughts 
- Dripline also (3) offers chance to develop Hypha's distinct voice. This will help distinguish from personal writing/takes on things, and the collective take
- How to best structure the Dripline/reading/writing practice so it's not make-work
- uv: need to block time to do this; dedicate weekly time for writing
- aa: concern that it might get pushed once deadlines come into play. How to avoid this? No easy answer here 
- How has writing process worked in the past? Co-writing has worked as follows
    - 1 person sets up the framework for piece
    - brainstorm on what things could be covered in the post
    - call or physical co-writing with 2-3 people to cover different sections
    - then revise and re-write; usually about 3 cycles for piece to take shape
- What is the threshold for a piece to be on Dripline? Don't want to create content for the sake of it; not a content mill
- Want there to be a distinct take. No 101s or round-ups 
- Hypha people have strong opinions about aspects of (eg distributed web; need to make these more public
 
### Process Checkout

- aa to schedule follow-up meeting
- will discuss Dripline as part of the Hypha-wide brainstorm next week
