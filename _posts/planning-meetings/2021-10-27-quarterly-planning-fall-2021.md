1. Ask people to update their hours in clockify
2. Use this generic link, replace STARTDATE + ENDDATE for that quarter: https://clockify.me/reports/summary?start=STARTDATET00:00:00.000Z&end=ENDDATET23:59:59.999Z&filterValuesData>T23:59:59.999Z&filterValuesData=%7B%22clients%22:%5B%225d0ba1b0a02f7a3e65052013%22%5D%7D&filterOptions=%7B%22clients%22:%7B%22status%22:%22ACTIVE%22%7D%7D
3. Go to our CRM and make a copy of this sheet:  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LyElXvLj7ASclSPQqcgOnuEWqBWBStilEfOhIosZzhA/edit#gid=858595530

During the call
1. Share screen with both
