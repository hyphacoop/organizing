## Appendix - AGM Explainer

**Articles of Incorporation** contain the key elements of a co-op’s structure and are filed with the provincial government.

**Bylaws** supplement the Act and the provisions of the Articles. They are adopted and enforced by the co-op internally (by the board of directors and membership), but they must not contradict the mandatory provisions of the Act or of the Articles.

**Policies** are internal guidelines and standards that a co-op uses as a framework to guide the day-to-day activities and decision-making processes of its members, board, employees and volunteers. For Hypha these are contained in our handbook.

**Decision-making** at the AGM:
- We have an official **chair** of the meeting
- Decisions are recorded as **resolutions that are voted** on by members (example language: “Be it resolved that… (BIRT) the bylaws below relating to the transaction of the affairs of (insert name of corporation) be passed.”)
- **Voting** requires enough of us are present to be confident that we have buy-in on decisions (“**quorum**” we are proposing 60% or 5/7 members) 
    - **Each person gets a single vote** only for themselves, you can not vote for someone not present ("serve as a proxy").
    - It will be by **open ballot** (i.e., we all see the results) for general business and, if needed, by **secret ballot** (i.e., only the chair of the meeting will see the results) for board of director positions 
    - Ideally, we will decide discussions and pass resolutions **by consensus**, if not possible, it goes to a vote that has to pass by **a simple majority** (50%+1 of those present, so 4/7,  3/5, 3/4). For particular issues where we cannot reach consensus, some identified in bylaws or ones arising, any member may request (by making a special motion with specific rules) that the resolution be decided by **a majority of two-thirds** (so 5/7, 4/5, 3/4).
    - For 2020 AGM **we will use Loomio to record these decisions**. 
- Depending on the decision, before/after decisions are made by the members, some have to be **adopted by the board of directors** also passing a resolution 

**Governance** is about the oversight, strategic planning, decision-making, and financial planning of an operation.

Different models (ways of framing it so that the parts and processes make sense) to think about governance:
> _Three key things_ that make [co-operative governance] function: “working well together, creating a successful view of the future, and building legitimacy” (from Governance in Co-operatives course prepared by Co-operatives First and Centre for the Study of Co-operatives).

> _Four pillars_ to address gaps and strengthen owner relationships and democratic practices
> - Teaming: successfully working together to achieve common purpose. 
> - Accountable empowerment: success-fully empowering people while at the same time holding them accountable for the power granted.
> - Strategic Leadership: successfully articulating the cooperative’s direction/purpose and setting up the organization for movement in this direction. 
> - Democracy: successfully practising, protecting, promoting, and perpetuating our healthy democracies.

**Management** is about the routine operational decisions and administrative work that makes the operation function.
